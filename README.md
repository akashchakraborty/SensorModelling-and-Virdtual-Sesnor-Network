# SensorModelling-and-Virdtual-Sesnor-Network
Here in this project we basically modeled Humidity, Temperature, Smoke and Light sensors by following all the errors that occur in reality and all the distortions in output depending on the external and internal factors. This helped us achieve a realistic models  rather than idealistic one. There after we fed data to the sensor models and got their outputs . We also fed some data to the sensors and sent that corresponding sensor reading to a "mosquitto server" using the mqtt protocol which was then received by the subscriber and according interpreted. Then all these functionalities were culminated into the GUI using Pyqt5


Run GUI.py for the results
